# ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Run through this checklist to ensure everything is set up correctly before starting.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Check

### Docker Setup
- [ ] Docker Desktop is installed and running
- [ ] `docker --version` returns a version (not error)
- [ ] `docker-compose --version` returns a version (not error)
- [ ] Port 8080 is available (not in use)

### File Structure
- [ ] All files exist in `c:\Users\thanishq\Documents\codecontrol\`
- [ ] Dockerfile present
- [ ] docker-compose.yml present
- [ ] backend/ directory exists with server.js
- [ ] frontend/ directory exists with package.json
- [ ] node_modules/ doesn't exist (will be created in Docker)

### Configuration Files
- [ ] .env.example exists (for reference)
- [ ] .gitignore exists
- [ ] .dockerignore exists
- [ ] README.md exists
- [ ] STARTUP.md exists

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### First-Time Build
```bash
# Run this command
docker-compose up --build

# Watch for messages:
# ‚úÖ Palworld Panel running on port 8080
# ‚úÖ Connected to SQLite database
# ‚úÖ Admin user created
```

### Verify Container
```bash
# In another terminal
docker ps
# Should show: palworld-panel    Up

docker logs palworld-panel
# Should show startup messages
```

### Access Panel
- [ ] Open http://localhost:8080 in browser
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Login form appears
- [ ] Can see default credentials message

### Test Login
- [ ] Enter username: `admin`
- [ ] Enter password: `changeme123`
- [ ] Login succeeds
- [ ] Dashboard appears

### Verify Features (After Login)
- [ ] Sidebar menu visible with all options
- [ ] Server Status page loads
- [ ] Console page shows logs
- [ ] Players page loads (empty OK)
- [ ] File Manager page loads
- [ ] Settings page loads

### Database Check
```bash
# Access container
docker exec -it palworld-panel /bin/bash

# Check database
ls -la /app/data/
# Should show: panel.db

# Verify tables
sqlite3 /app/data/panel.db ".tables"
# Should show: server_logs, server_settings, users
```

### Volume Check
```bash
# List volumes
docker volume ls
# Should show: palworld_data, palworld_app_data

# Inspect volumes
docker volume inspect palworld_data
docker volume inspect palworld_app_data
```

## üîê Security Checklist

### Before Production
- [ ] Change ADMIN_PASSWORD in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Generate new JWT_SECRET with random string
- [ ] Review .env.example for all settings
- [ ] Restart with new credentials:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- [ ] Test login with new credentials

### Network Security
- [ ] Port 8080 is only accessible on your network
- [ ] If using Cloudflare, verify tunnel URL is secure
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on Cloudflare tunnel

## üßπ Cleanup Verification

### Test Clean Removal
```bash
# Stop everything
docker-compose down -v

# Verify removal
docker ps -a
# Should NOT show palworld-panel

docker volume ls
# Should NOT show palworld_data, palworld_app_data
```

### Verify Clean Start
```bash
# Start fresh
docker-compose up --build

# Should create new container with fresh database
# New admin user will be created with default credentials
```

## üìä Performance Check

### Monitor Resources
```bash
# Check Docker stats
docker stats palworld-panel

# Watch for:
# - Memory: Should be < 500MB
# - CPU: Should be < 5% idle
```

### Test Responsiveness
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 1 second
- [ ] Console updates in real-time
- [ ] Button clicks respond immediately
- [ ] No console errors in browser (F12)

## üîó Remote Access Check (Optional)

### Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
```bash
# Install cloudflared
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/

# Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run --url http://localhost:8080

# Get tunnel URL and test access
```

- [ ] Tunnel URL is displayed
- [ ] Can access panel from tunnel URL
- [ ] Login works with tunnel
- [ ] All features accessible via tunnel

## üéØ Final Verification

After all checks above, mark this list:

- [ ] Docker working correctly
- [ ] Container starts and stays running
- [ ] Panel accessible at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Database created and populated
- [ ] Volumes created correctly
- [ ] Clean removal works (docker-compose down -v)
- [ ] Fresh start works (docker-compose up --build)
- [ ] Security settings changed (if needed)

## ‚ú® You're Ready!

Once all checks are complete, you have a fully working Palworld Management Panel! üöÄ

### Troubleshooting

If any check fails, refer to:
1. **Docker Errors**: Check `docker logs palworld-panel`
2. **Port Issues**: Change port in docker-compose.yml
3. **Build Errors**: Run `docker-compose up --build` (force rebuild)
4. **Permission Issues**: May need `sudo` on Linux/Mac
5. **Database Errors**: Try `docker-compose down -v` (full reset)
